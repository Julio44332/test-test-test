    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A tab-based single-page application. The default view is an 'Explore the Park' section with filterable cards for attractions. Additional tabs for 'Journey Through Time,' 'Shop & Dine,' and 'Plan Your Visit' (for hotels) logically group the report's content. This structure prioritizes user task-orientation (planning a visit, learning history) over the report's linear format, enhancing usability and making information discovery intuitive and efficient. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: History is visualized as an interactive Chart.js line chart to show progression over time; clicking points reveals details. Attractions, shops, and hotels are presented as filterable or categorized grids of cards for easy comparison. This approach uses the best interactive method for each type of content, avoiding static tables and focusing on user engagement. All visualizations are built with Chart.js or HTML/CSS via Tailwind, adhering to the NO SVG/Mermaid constraint. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
